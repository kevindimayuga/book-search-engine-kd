# Book Search Engine

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

M21 - This repo is for a MERN stack book search engine application with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It will be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app will be built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

The motivation behind this project is to learn how to build a MERN stack application that uses GraphQL and Apollo Server.

- Submit URL to GitHub Repo and link to video walkthrough

## Usage

- Clone repo onto local device
- Open repo in local CLI
- Make sure node packages are installed by running `npm i` in root directory in the CLI
- Run `npm run build` in the CLI to build the application
    - A dist folder will be created which will include a manifest.json and the src-sw.js files (along with all the other bundled files)
- Run `npm run start` in the CLI to start the server
- Open up [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in the browser to view the book search engine application
- Open up [localhost:3001/graphql](localhost:3001/graphql) in the browser to view the GraphQL playground
- Use the book search engine to search for books
